00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,190
"We shall not cease from exploration

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,137
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,051
and know the place for the first time."
- T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding"

4
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:14,928
"After the game is before the game."
- S. Herberger

5
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:31,214
<i>Man, </i>

6
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:35,404
<i>probably the most mysterious species
on our planet. </i>

7
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:38,517
<i>A mystery of unanswered questions. </i>

8
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:42,343
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from? </i>

9
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,759
<i>Where are we going?
How do we know what we think we know? </i>

10
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:51,958
<i>Why do we believe anything at all? </i>

11
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:55,936
<i>Countless questions in search of an answer, </i>

12
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,889
<i>an answer that will give rise
to a new question, </i>

13
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,520
<i>and the next answer will give rise
to the next question and so on. </i>

14
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:12,435
<i>But, in the end,
isn't it always the same question? </i>

15
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,928
<i>And always the same answer? </i>

16
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:23,923
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes. That's a fact.

17
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:26,194
Everything else is pure theory.

18
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,335
Here we go!

19
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,216
RUN LOLA RUN

20
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,062
- Manni?
- Lola.

21
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,251
What's up? Where are you?

22
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,020
Where were you, damn it?

23
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:29,789
- I got there too late.
- But why today? You're always on time!

24
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,010
My moped got ripped off. It doesn't matter.

25
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,410
Yes, it matters!

26
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,403
What's wrong?

27
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:41,427
It wasn't my fault, Manni.
I went to get some cigarettes.

28
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,889
<i>I can't believe how fast that guy was. </i>

29
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,882
<i>There was nothing I could do.
He was gone before I got outside. </i>

30
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:48,614
<i>I even took a taxi. </i>

31
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:53,233
<i>That dumbass drove east.
They got a Grunewald Street there, too. </i>

32
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,796
<i>When I noticed, it was too late. </i>

33
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:59,064
<i>It just didn't occur to me.
I was so screwed up because of our moped. </i>

34
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:01,676
<i>- Doesn't matter.
- And when I got there, you were gone. </i>

35
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,070
It doesn't matter now anyway. I'm done for.

36
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,955
- But why?
- Help me, Lola!

37
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,576
<i>I don't know what to do. </i>

38
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,568
You weren't there, and I messed it up.

39
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,960
<i>I blew it. I'm such a jerk! </i>

40
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:19,548
<i>Just calm down. Now what happened? </i>

41
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,870
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay? </i>

42
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,153
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

43
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,633
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

44
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:32,648
<i>- Did you get caught?
- No, but that would've been something.</i>

45
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,336
<i>Everything went really great. We drove
the cars there, and those guys came. </i>

46
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,637
<i>They paid, and that was it. Easy as pie. </i>

47
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:45,182
<i>I got waved across the border,
and then they dropped me off out there. </i>

48
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,030
<i>Then I went to see that cyclops,
and he was finished in no time. </i>

49
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:52,533
<i>And everything was on time, except for you. </i>

50
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,536
<i>You weren't there. </i>

51
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:59,941
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

52
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,485
<i>I couldn't even call a taxi,
so I walked to the subway station. </i>

53
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:06,654
<i>On the train, there was this bum</i>

54
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:09,316
<i>who somehow fell down,
and suddenly these inspectors showed up. </i>

55
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,268
<i>And I got out like always, an old reflex. </i>

56
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:30,374
- The bag!
- The bag.

57
00:06:58,624 --> 00:06:59,884
The bag!

58
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:04,457
I'm such a fucking amateur! A dumbass!

59
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:09,172
<i>This could only happen to me! If you'd
picked me up, it wouldn't have happened. </i>

60
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,933
<i>I was so out of it.
You're always on time otherwise! </i>

61
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,771
<i>- Didn't you call the next station?
- Sure. </i>

62
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,648
<i>But it was too late.
The fucking bag was already gone. </i>

63
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:20,774
<i>And I know who has it. That bum!
That plastic-bag freak! </i>

64
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:23,513
<i>He's on a plane to Florida or Hawaii</i>

65
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:27,563
<i>or Canada or Hong Kong
or Bermuda or whatever. </i>

66
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,210
<i>- What about Ronnie?
- He'll kill me. </i>

67
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:35,397
- You gotta tell him.
- Forget it!

68
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:37,674
- Why?
- He won't believe a single word.

69
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:41,786
<i>I kept a carton of cigarettes once.
He noticed right away. </i>

70
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,304
<i>He doesn't believe anybody. </i>

71
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:47,923
The jobs with those mercs was a kind of test

72
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,864
<i>to see if he could trust me. </i>

73
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,345
How much was there, in the bag?

74
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,595
- 100,000.
- What?

75
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:03,438
- 100,000. A test.
- Oh, shit!

76
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,145
<i>See! I knew you wouldn't come up
with any idea. </i>

77
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:09,397
I always said someday
you wouldn't know what to do.

78
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,258
Not when you die, sooner!

79
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:13,896
You said, "Love can do everything."

80
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:17,065
- So find 100,000 marks in 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes?

81
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,929
At 12:00 by the water tower
around the corner, Ronnie said.

82
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,646
<i>- In 20 minutes.
- Run away, Manni!</i>

83
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,529
- No.
- Why not?

84
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:28,804
- Nobody escapes Ronnie.
- I'll go with you.

85
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:32,182
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes,
I'll be a goner.

86
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,123
Stop it, Manni!

87
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,709
What for? You can't get me 100 grand either!

88
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:40,811
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100,000 ashes

89
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:44,044
floating down the Spree to the North Sea,
and no more Manni!

90
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:47,244
- You can't do a thing!
- Shut up!

91
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,584
Listen.

92
00:08:57,731 --> 00:09:02,281
Wait for me. I'll help you.
Stay put. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

93
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:04,466
<i>- Okay?
- Gonna pawn all your jewelry?</i>

94
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,448
Where are you?

95
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,440
In a phone booth, downtown,
in front of the Spirale Bar.

96
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,789
<i>Okay, stay where you are.
I promise I'll come up with something. </i>

97
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,219
In 20 minutes, okay?

98
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:19,956
What the hell. I'll go over to the Bolle
and get that 100 grand.

99
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:20,996
Cut it out!

100
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:24,658
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day,
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

101
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,708
<i>You're nuts! Don't do a thing!
Just stay in the damned booth! I'm coming. </i>

102
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:31,897
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Are you cracked?

103
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:35,853
- Don't do a thing! Stay put! I'm coming.
- Then what?

104
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,237
I'll think of something!

105
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:40,373
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

106
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,281
- No, wait!
- What for?

107
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,327
I'll get the money somehow.

108
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm going in there at 12:00 if you aren't here.

109
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:22,538
Okay! Who? Who?

110
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:56,166
Dad!

111
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,788
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

112
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:12,355
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

113
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,631
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

114
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:21,122
Yeah, but you're married too.

115
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:16,487
Hey! Get your eyes open!

116
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,641
You bitch.

117
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,661
AND
THEN

118
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,667
It's worst at night.

119
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,467
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

120
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:32,226
And then I'm afraid.

121
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:34,268
Me! Afraid of the dark.

122
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:38,678
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never been afraid before.

123
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:42,778
But I think about us,

124
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:48,896
and I just think it'll keep going on like this.

125
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,254
And you wouldn't dare...

126
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,663
And then I ask myself what I'm doing here.

127
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:10,088
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

128
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:15,778
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

129
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,047
Hey! You need a bike?

130
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:57,021
Fifty marks, as good as new.

131
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:58,942
No.

132
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,997
Hey, man, I know that!

133
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,532
It's not my fault it's so much money!

134
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,169
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

135
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,984
Thanks.

136
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,440
Your phone card!

137
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,567
I have to go. Meyer will be here in a minute.

138
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:00,131
Can we meet later on?

139
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,943
- Do you love me?
- What?

140
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:05,987
Do you love me?

141
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,108
Why are you asking now?

142
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,558
Do you love me?

143
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,702
Yes, I do, damn it!

144
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,663
Then decide.

145
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,155
But not now!

146
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,938
You have to decide sometime.

147
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,760
But why now, here, at once?

148
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,630
Because I'm pregnant.

149
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:45,167
Hey, look at that. Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

150
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,430
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

151
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:52,946
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

152
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,104
Sorry.

153
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:20,108
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

154
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,035
Yes.

155
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:30,746
Lola?

156
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,356
Dad.

157
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,197
Your daughter?

158
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:43,028
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

159
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:45,532
Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.

160
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,213
It's okay. I was just about to...

161
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,590
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

162
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,111
Nothing.

163
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:10,791
Listen, if I tell you I need your help

164
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:15,345
more than ever in my whole life, and
you're the only one who can help me,

165
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
would you help me?

166
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,311
- You look terrible.
- Would you help me?

167
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:22,149
- What happened?
- I can't explain now. Would you help me?

168
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:23,948
With what, damn it?

169
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,669
- I need 100,000 marks immediately.
- What?

170
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,620
I need it within the next five minutes,
or else...

171
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,951
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

172
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,198
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

173
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,000
Please, Dad! You gotta help me! Please!

174
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:43,301
- I don't have 100,000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

175
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,210
What about it? It isn't worth 100,000.

176
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,875
Please, Dad. I'm serious. This isn't a joke.

177
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:54,421
- Yes, it is, Lola! You can't be serious!
- If you don't help me, he'll die!

178
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,016
- Who'll die?
- Manni.

179
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,573
Who's Manni?

180
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,676
My boyfriend, for over a year!

181
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:03,507
- I don't even know him. Why will he die?
- It doesn't matter!

182
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,245
Okay, come with me.

183
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,625
- Are you going to help me?
- Of course.

184
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:27,099
Go home and go to bed.

185
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:31,992
And tell your mother I won't be home
today or tomorrow or ever again.

186
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:35,406
I'm leaving you guys
and marrying another woman.

187
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:40,889
We're going to have kids, and I'll try
to be happy because she wants me.

188
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:46,156
I'm so sick of hearing, "All you do
is work. You always play the boss."

189
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:50,011
Maybe so, but so what?
You guys have no idea!

190
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:53,474
I'm so tired of being the fool,
the one to blame!

191
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:58,075
But Daddy's dough is good enough, huh?
Well, not anymore!

192
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,141
Anyway, I'd never have fathered
a weirdo like you.

193
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,905
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

194
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,570
All I'm saying is you're a cuckoo's egg.

195
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,954
Now you know.

196
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:27,312
The guy who fathered you
didn't live to see your birth.

197
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,900
Throw her out, please.

198
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,577
Come on! Get her out of here!

199
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:09,422
Well, we all have our bad days.

200
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:14,066
See you around.

201
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:28,093
My dear,

202
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,148
what's wrong?

203
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,109
Do you have the time?

204
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:14,717
This afternoon?

205
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,107
All right. No, forget it.

206
00:23:19,203 --> 00:23:22,003
It's okay. Yeah.

207
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:53,842
<i>Wait! </i>

208
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,733
<i>Don't do it! </i>

209
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,650
<i>Manni, please! </i>

210
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:01,858
<i>Wait for me! </i>

211
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:05,176
<i>I'll be right there. </i>

212
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,118
<i>Please. </i>

213
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:10,376
<i>Manni, please, wait! </i>

214
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,757
Manni!

215
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,971
Okay.

216
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,348
Okay.

217
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,837
Lie down on the floor!

218
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,397
On the floor!

219
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,226
Hands behind your head and keep quiet!

220
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:09,881
Hands behind your head and keep quiet.

221
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:14,686
Open the cash registers!
Open all the cash registers!

222
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,379
Open them and lie down!
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

223
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,251
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

224
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,739
Manni!

225
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:34,255
- Lola, where were you?
- I couldn't get here faster.

226
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:37,865
- Will you help me?
- Can't we just get out of here?

227
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,537
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

228
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:44,492
Why didn't you wait for me?

229
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,653
I did. You got here too late.

230
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,820
So, are you with me?

231
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:52,975
Put your hands up! Fast!

232
00:26:57,396 --> 00:26:58,356
Come on!

233
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:05,014
Drop your gun! Hurry up!

234
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:12,946
Don't move.

235
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,998
The safety catch is on.

236
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,855
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

237
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,436
Girl, listen...

238
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,956
Don't move.

239
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,980
Come here.

240
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,771
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

241
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:52,504
Hurry, before the cops come.

242
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,147
Don't move!

243
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,791
Manni?

244
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:18,764
Do you love me?

245
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,586
Sure, I do.

246
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,058
How can you be so sure?

247
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:31,866
I don't know. I just am.

248
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:35,166
I could be some other girl.

249
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,331
Why not?

250
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:42,946
Because you're the best.

251
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:45,777
- The best what?
- The best girl.

252
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,086
Of all the girls in the world?

253
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,470
Sure.

254
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:53,868
How do you know?

255
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,050
I just do.

256
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:01,222
You think so.

257
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,695
Okay, I think so.

258
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,130
- You see?
- What?

259
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,742
You aren't sure.

260
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,120
Are you nuts or what?

261
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,167
What if you never met me?

262
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,178
What do you mean?

263
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,511
You'd be telling the same thing
to someone else.

264
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,200
Okay, if you don't want to hear it.

265
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:33,204
I don't want to hear anything.
I want to know how you feel.

266
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:37,218
Okay, my feelings say

267
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:41,055
that you're the best.

268
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:45,543
Who is "your feelings" anyway?

269
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,098
It's me.

270
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:50,958
My heart.

271
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:53,692
Your heart says, "Hi, Manni. She's the one."

272
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:57,182
- Exactly.
- And you say,

273
00:31:57,297 --> 00:32:00,177
"Thanks for the information.
See you around."

274
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,130
Exactly.

275
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,874
And you do whatever your heart says?

276
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,889
Well, it really doesn't "say" anything.

277
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,431
I don't know.

278
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,865
It just feels.

279
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,891
So what does it feel now?

280
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,166
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

281
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:22,178
Man, you aren't taking me seriously.

282
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:24,273
Lola, what's wrong?

283
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,229
You want to leave me?

284
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:33,569
I don't know.

285
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:39,742
I think I have to make a decision.

286
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:55,437
But I don't want to. I don't want to leave.

287
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:03,914
Stop.

288
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:12,763
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

289
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:18,732
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

290
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:22,975
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

291
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:27,467
Yeah, but you're married too.

292
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,448
Watch out, you stupid cow!

293
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,710
Fucking bitch!

294
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:47,491
- Hey! You need a bike?
- No.

295
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:50,353
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

296
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,721
500? What am I supposed
to do with 500 marks?

297
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:47,314
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

298
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,066
Yes.

299
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:06,905
Even if it isn't from you?

300
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,724
Hey, look at that. Our little princess.

301
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,407
I'm in a hurry, please!

302
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,381
Let me in.

303
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,835
Courtesy and composure
are the queen's jewels.

304
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:26,181
- Let me in, please.
- A little anger is good for the heart,

305
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:28,916
the circulation, the skin.

306
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:52,866
I don't care whether it was an accident
or not! Great start for a new love!

307
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,404
If you hadn't neglected me,
it wouldn't have happened.

308
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:57,081
I have a family!

309
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,139
I can't leave a sick wife and three kids
just to please Her Highness.

310
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,650
Your wife is drunk from morning to night!

311
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,230
So what? What do you know?

312
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:08,254
Don't you see you're bothering us?

313
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,530
Lola?

314
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:14,002
Hi, Dad.

315
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,424
Why didn't you knock?

316
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,251
What's going on?

317
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:22,637
- What do you want?
- Is she your daughter?

318
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:24,685
Shut the door.

319
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,493
What do you want?

320
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:34,193
- I need your help.
- You see that I'm busy.

321
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,460
- There's no other way.
- Damn it!

322
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:38,899
Why are you disturbing me right now?

323
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:41,048
I have a problem, you understand?

324
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,450
- Who's that slut?
- That's none of your business!

325
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,489
Lola, leave.

326
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,875
Go home. Leave me alone.

327
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:04,525
I can't!

328
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:05,868
Why not?

329
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,073
I need money.

330
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:13,079
- Then get a job.
- I will, but I need the money now!

331
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:18,653
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

332
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:20,978
No, no. I need lots more.

333
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:25,125
- What do you mean, "lots more"?
- A whole lot more!

334
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,580
Aren't you ashamed, barging in like this?
Can't you see we're busy?

335
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,591
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

336
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:35,245
Don't you dare...

337
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,094
What?

338
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,422
Hey! What's up? What's up?

339
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:28,402
It just isn't your day today. Doesn't matter.

340
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:30,277
You can't have everything.

341
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,071
Come with me.

342
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,949
Have you gone crazy?

343
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,700
- Think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

344
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:20,292
Girl, listen.
You don't know how to use that thing.

345
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:24,183
Let me make a suggestion.

346
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:46,848
Get away.

347
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,611
- Listen, dear, we can talk it over...
- Fuck off!

348
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:09,062
- Shit!
- The combination.

349
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,864
Quiet!

350
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,376
Lola, what...

351
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,893
What the heck are you doing?

352
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:30,789
Open up!

353
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:47,818
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

354
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:50,426
The police will be here in a second.

355
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:53,651
You said they always come too late.

356
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:56,265
Bag it, 100,000.

357
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:08,119
Come on, little miss.

358
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:10,481
Leave your daddy alone.

359
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:14,377
You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?

360
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:15,836
I don't know.

361
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:34,503
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

362
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:38,065
There's only 88,000.

363
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:42,524
I'll have to get the rest from downstairs.

364
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:47,559
Okay, get going. Go, go!

365
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,730
Hurry up, man!

366
00:44:45,428 --> 00:44:46,898
100,000.

367
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:51,922
In there.

368
00:45:18,915 --> 00:45:20,705
Bye, Dad.

369
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:42,258
I don't believe it.

370
00:45:50,597 --> 00:45:52,387
Hey, girl. Get away.

371
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,340
Get away from there!

372
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:05,068
Hey, girl, you want to get killed?

373
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:14,054
<i>Attention! This is the police! </i>

374
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:18,179
<i>The building is surrounded... </i>

375
00:46:19,365 --> 00:46:22,455
- What a ruckus.
- Do you have the time?

376
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:48,317
Okay.

377
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:55,924
Hey, get away!

378
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:01,228
Give me a lift, will you? Please?

379
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,145
Wait!

380
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,289
<i>Wait, Manni. I'm coming. </i>

381
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,161
<i>I'm almost there. </i>

382
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,780
<i>Wait! I'm gonna make it. </i>

383
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:11,161
Lola.

384
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:16,166
What would you do if I died?

385
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:19,191
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, well,

386
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:22,874
what if I were fatally ill?

387
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,189
I'd find a way.

388
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,460
What if I were in a coma,
and the doc said, "One more day"?

389
00:50:28,481 --> 00:50:31,281
I'd throw you into the ocean, shock therapy.

390
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:34,407
What if I were dead anyway?

391
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:38,484
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on. Tell me.

392
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,420
I'd go to the Isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

393
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:43,639
And then?

394
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:47,447
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

395
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,754
I know what you'd do. You'd forget me.

396
00:50:51,774 --> 00:50:53,244
- No!
- Sure you would.

397
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:59,005
What else could you do?
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

398
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:03,224
Not a bad idea.
And everybody's real compassionate,

399
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:07,913
and everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

400
00:51:08,957 --> 00:51:13,507
You can show everyone how strong you
are. "What a great woman," they'll say.

401
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:17,101
"She really pulls herself together
instead of crying all day."

402
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:22,572
And all at once this really nice guy
with green eyes shows up.

403
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:25,882
And he's super sensitive,
listens to you all day.

404
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:27,739
And you can talk his ear off.

405
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,250
And you can tell him
how tough things are for you,

406
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:34,958
and that you have to look after yourself
and don't know what's gonna happen,

407
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:38,101
and blah, blah, blah.

408
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:42,496
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

409
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,463
- Manni.
- What?

410
00:51:46,557 --> 00:51:48,347
You haven't died yet.

411
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,800
No?

412
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:17,209
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

413
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:22,767
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

414
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:27,003
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

415
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:31,495
Yeah, but you're married too.

416
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:20,851
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

417
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:22,732
I bet you're sorry.

418
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:44,001
Fries and a sausage.

419
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,080
Give me another one.

420
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,200
I'll be damned.

421
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:54,599
Life's really crazy sometimes, isn't it?

422
00:54:57,698 --> 00:55:00,628
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

423
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,479
You need a bike?

424
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:08,718
A special price, 70 marks.

425
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,906
Lola?

426
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:27,567
Mr. Meyer?

427
00:55:27,702 --> 00:55:29,422
Is everything okay?

428
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:31,285
No.

429
00:55:57,957 --> 00:56:01,367
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

430
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,331
Yes.

431
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:11,648
<i>Mr. Meyer is here. </i>

432
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:14,941
- There's something else.
- Not now.

433
00:56:15,053 --> 00:56:17,473
<i>Mr. Meyer asked if he should park,
or if you're coming out. </i>

434
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:19,325
Coming.

435
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:22,437
That's the nicest present
you could ever give me.

436
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:30,472
Can we meet later on?

437
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,817
Hi there.

438
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:56,047
Hi there, Ms. Jäger.

439
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:13,389
- Hi there.
- Hello.

440
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,453
Hi.

441
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,809
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

442
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,482
Dad!

443
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:03,541
Wait!

444
00:58:05,243 --> 00:58:09,293
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

445
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:11,367
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, with your daughter.

446
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:13,945
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

447
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,626
Dad!

448
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:19,435
Shit! Shit!

449
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:35,726
You've come at last, dear.

450
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:05,911
Thanks.

451
00:59:06,063 --> 00:59:07,563
Wait.

452
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:37,215
So I decided it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

453
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:39,935
I work so much that they'd never see me.

454
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:45,943
Watch out!

455
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:21,159
<i>What can I do? </i>

456
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,487
<i>What can I do? </i>

457
01:00:34,992 --> 01:00:36,382
<i>Come on. </i>

458
01:00:38,713 --> 01:00:40,053
<i>Help me. </i>

459
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:42,557
<i>Please. </i>

460
01:00:44,783 --> 01:00:46,623
<i>Just this once. </i>

461
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,800
<i>I'll just keep on running, okay? </i>

462
01:00:56,176 --> 01:00:57,886
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

463
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:01,551
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

464
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:04,321
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

465
01:01:04,403 --> 01:01:06,613
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

466
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:15,502
You wanna get killed?

467
01:01:47,919 --> 01:01:50,129
- How does this work?
- You buy chips

468
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,780
- and gamble them away.
- Okay.

469
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,260
You can't go in there like that.

470
01:01:57,383 --> 01:01:58,603
I have to.

471
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:02,901
Ninety-nine marks, 20. What kind of chips?

472
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,443
One for 100?

473
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,990
You're short.

474
01:02:07,614 --> 01:02:08,824
Please.

475
01:02:42,979 --> 01:02:45,139
Place your bets, please.

476
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:54,852
Your bets, please.

477
01:03:04,546 --> 01:03:06,386
No more bets.

478
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:16,938
Twenty, black, even, pass. No series.

479
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:24,016
1,500 for black.

480
01:03:30,637 --> 01:03:33,437
One hundred and 400.

481
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:40,362
Three thousand, five hundred
for 100 marks on 20.

482
01:03:45,308 --> 01:03:47,388
Here you are, 3,500.

483
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,543
Come with me, please.

484
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:08,026
Just one more game.

485
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,175
Please place your bets.

486
01:05:21,996 --> 01:05:25,706
Twenty, black, even, pass.

487
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:35,623
Hurry up. I need a plastic bag.

488
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:26,914
Stop!

489
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,234
That's mine.

490
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:48,712
I know!

491
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,022
I'm sorry.

492
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,969
And what about me?

493
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:10,389
At least give me that.

494
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,650
What're you doing here?

495
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:43,739
- I'll stay with him.
- What?

496
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:36,741
Okay.

497
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,086
Manni?

498
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:29,234
Manni?

499
01:11:39,522 --> 01:11:40,402
Hey.

500
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,251
What happened to you?

501
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,740
Did you run here?

502
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,310
Don't worry. Everything's okay. Come on.

503
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,300
What's in the bag?
